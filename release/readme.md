0.1.0 This is a very early release and will probably work for about 30 clicks before you find a way to crash it, but meh, it works... kinda.
0.2.0 This is now much more stable and optimised, and I've added features:
  - added responsive resizing to the view controls
  - cleaned some of the UI elements
  - optimised the calculation algorythym to skip uninteresting lines
  - cleaned up the event triggers so they don't accidentally trigger multiple times, improving performance
